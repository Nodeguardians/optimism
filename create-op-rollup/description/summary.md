# Summary

In this quest, we explored the OP stack and setup a custom L2 on top of Goerli L1.

This involved setting up several account and running the necessary software to have the L2 running and syncing to Goerli periodically.
Ultimately we managed to bridge some funds to this custom L2 and recorded a state transition on the L1.
