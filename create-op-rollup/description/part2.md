# Creating an OP Rollup

Once you are confident you have a working OP Rollup, with at least one produced block, you are ready to complete Thaddeus' magical lute.

## Your Task

Link your working rollup with `MagicLute` by registering the rollup's `OptimismPortal` address. If your rollup has at least one block synced to the L1, you will be able to complete this quest!
